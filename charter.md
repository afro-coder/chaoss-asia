## Goals

- Build a strong and inclusive open source community in Asia
 - Promote collaboration and networking within the Asian open source community

- Measure and celebrate the impact of the Asian open source community

- Enable access to technical education and skill development through tailored mentorship programs.

## Scope and Ownership

### In scope

The following activities fall within the scope of this chapter

- Build and maintain a community database specific to the Asian context.
  - This may be extended to a global context, after a successful POC, through collaboration with other regional leads and the DEI working group.

- Establish and staff focus groups within the chapter toward achievement of the [goals](#goals)mentioned above
  - The focus groups will also be governed by the [CHAOSS Community Code of Conduct](https://chaoss.community/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=In%20the%20interest%20of%20fostering,%2C%20level%20of%20experience%2C%20education%2C)
  - They will collaborate with other WGs/areas of the CHAOSS project to execute tasks. For a full list, see **chaoss-groups** under the [community repository](https://github.com/chaoss/community/)
  - Focus groups must be staffed by trusted contributors.

- Own and execute events related to the CHAOSS Asia community including:
  -[Fortnightly community meeting](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Kolkata/2024-03-07/08:00/b/CHAOSS%20Asia%20Community%20Meetings#eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2NhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vY2FsZW5kYXIvdS8wL3IvbW9udGgvMjAyNC8zLzc/Y3R6PUFtZXJpY2EvQ2hpY2FnbyJ9)

- Help onboard new and current contributors into the culture and workflow of the CHAOSS project through the [quick start for new contributors](https://chaoss.community/kb-getting-started/), other related documentation, and programs tailored to onboarding.

- Perform issue triage on and maintain the [chaoss/chaoss-asia](https://github.com/chaoss/chaoss-asia/) repository

### Out of scope

- We are not the [code of conduct team](chaoss-conduct@googlegroups.com:) and therefore do not control incident management, reporting, or decisions; however, specific to [the chaoss-asia GitHub repository](https://github.com/chaoss/chaoss-asia) and the [#chaossasia Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/chaoss-workspace/shared_invite/zt-r65szij9-QajX59hkZUct82b0uACA6g) the code of conduct allows project maintainers to act swiftly if there is a clear violation of terms. If there is an action that the committee needs to take that involves one of these platforms, we will carry that out if the committee members do not have access or in their absence.
